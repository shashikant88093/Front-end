# Advanced React & JavaScript Concepts

## 1. Advanced JavaScript Concepts

### ES6+ Features:

- [x] - Arrow
- [x] -  functions,
- [x] -  destructuring, 
- [ ] - template literals
- [ ] - Default/rest/spread operators
- [ ] - Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet
- [ ] - Promises, async/await, 
- [ ] - generators
- [ ] - Modules (import/export)
- [ ] - Closures,
- [ ] -  lexical scoping,
- [ ] -  currying
- [x] - Debouncing 
- [ ] - throttling

### Memory Management in JS:
- Event loops, stack vs. heap, garbage collection.

### Asynchronous Patterns:
- Understanding of microtasks and macrotasks, event loop internals.

### JavaScript Design Patterns:
- Module pattern, Singleton, Factory, Observer, and MVC.

### JavaScript Engines and Optimizations:
- V8 internals, Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

## 2. React Fundamentals and Beyond

### Functional Components vs Class Components:
- Mastering Functional Components with hooks.
- Understanding Class Components (though functional is preferred now).

### React Lifecycle (Class and Functional):
- Detailed understanding of lifecycle methods in class-based components and corresponding Hooks in functional components (e.g., useEffect, useState).

### React Context API:
- Learn advanced patterns, including using Context with Hooks for state management.

### Hooks API:
- Use of `useEffect`, `useReducer`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useContext`.

### React Router:
- Routing, dynamic route parameters, nested routing, lazy loading components.

### Code Splitting:
- Understanding how to split bundles efficiently using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.

## 3. State Management Libraries

### Redux:
- Redux Thunk, Redux Toolkit, and Redux Saga.
- Advanced patterns with Redux (e.g., middleware creation, reselect, advanced selectors).
- Handling side-effects, normalization, optimistic updates.
- Using Redux with TypeScript for type safety.

### MobX:
- Understanding of reactive programming patterns and observer patterns.
- Using MobX with React and how to manage the app state reactively.

### Recoil and other new state management tools.

## 4. Performance Optimization

### Reconciliation Algorithm:
- Understand how React compares old vs new virtual DOM to minimize actual DOM operations.

### Rendering Optimizations:
- Using `PureComponent`, `React.memo`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks.

### Lazy Loading Components:
- Dynamic imports and route-based code splitting to improve performance.

### Web Vitals:
- Measure and optimize CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift), FCP (First Contentful Paint), LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), FID (First Input Delay).

### Memoization Techniques.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR) vs. Client-Side Rendering (CSR):
- Optimizing them using React Suspense and Next.js.

## 5. Modern Build Tools & Development Practices

### Babel and Webpack:
- Understanding the Babel transformation process.
- Advanced Webpack configurations: loaders, plugins, hot module replacement (HMR), etc.

### TypeScript:
- Leveraging types for better code quality and type safety in React apps.

### CI/CD Pipelines:
- Automating testing, building, and deploying React applications with tools like Jest, Travis CI, CircleCI.

### Linting:
- Setting up ESLint, Prettier for code quality and consistency.

## 6. Component Design & Architecture

### Atomic Design Principles:
- Structuring components in atomic, molecule, organism, and page layers.

### UI Libraries & Design Systems:
- Advanced use of design libraries like Chakra UI, Material UI, or Styled Components.
- Implementing responsive design and themable UI.

### Custom Hooks:
- Writing reusable, encapsulated hooks to simplify code reuse.

## 7. Testing

### Unit Testing with Jest and React Testing Library:
- Test-driven development (TDD) with React applications.
- Testing lifecycle methods, hooks, context API.

### Integration and End-to-End Testing:
- Tools like Cypress or Puppeteer for E2E testing.
- Using MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking.

## 8. Advanced Topics

### SSR (Server-Side Rendering):
- Understanding SSR with React to make your app SEO-friendly and performance-optimized.
- Implementing SSR with Next.js.

### Static Site Generation (SSG):
- Learn about static generation, particularly with Next.js, for high-performance sites.

### Progressive Web Apps (PWA):
- Creating web applications that can work offline and provide mobile-native experience.

### WebAssembly (WASM):
- Integrate React with WebAssembly for performance-critical applications.

## 9. Modern JavaScript APIs

- Service Workers and Web Push Notifications.
- WebSockets and Socket.IO: For real-time applications.
- Web Workers: Multi-threading for heavy computations in the browser.
- File System Access API: Understanding how to work with the native file system in the browser.

## 10. Collaborative & Project Management Skills

### Monorepos:
- Using tools like Lerna, Nx for managing large-scale projects.

### Versioning & Code Collaboration:
- Advanced Git techniques (rebasing, squashing commits, hooks).
- Setting up GitHub Actions for custom workflows.

### Documentation:
- Effective documentation practices with Markdown, Storybook for UI components, and JSDoc for code annotations.

### Agile Methodology:
- Embracing Scrum, Kanban, and other agile practices.
